# Random Password Generator

JavaScript

## My Task

For this challenge, I modified starter code to create an application that enables an employee to generate a random password based on their chosen criteria.

The modified code satisfies the following requirements:
* The employee is presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
* The employee is prompted to choose the length of the password (between 8 and 128 characters) and whether to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numerals, and/or special characters.
* Once the employee answers the prompts, a password consistent with their selections is randomly generated and displayed.
